The IoT platform used here is Google Firebase.Hardware used is NodeMCU and DHT11. Sensor value is uploaded onto Firebase, where can analysis, manipulate and visualise using different Firebase machine learning models. The location of the sensor can also be set here, so that multiple sensor positions and its location can be analysed.
